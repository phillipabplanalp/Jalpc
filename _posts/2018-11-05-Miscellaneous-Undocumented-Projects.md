<h1>Miscellaneous Undocumented Projects</h1>

<p class="ex1">
Other projects which I’ve worked on but that haven’t been formally documented listed below:

<p class="ex1">
-	Radio-Controlled ethanol-powered model aeroplane – built from kitset – 2001-2002
-	Enclosed kart racing trailer – This was designed to carry two karts + spare parts – 2004-2006
-	Engine Dyno – This was a project to build a test bench for testing our kart racing engines. It was designed to be an inertia-based dyno, using two old truck flywheels as its accelerating inertia. Using the equation τ = Iα the torque could be calculated. Using RPM and torque, power can be calculated - 2004-2006
-	Robotic Lawn Mower Project v1 - 2010
-	Electroluminescent driver - This project used a 3.7V (Li-Po) input and stepped it up to 60V square wave AC.  It used custom buck boost with a H – Bridge to generate the AC - 2013
-	House Renovations – I bought a house in 2015 and have been doing a number of improvements to it over this time - 2015-2019
